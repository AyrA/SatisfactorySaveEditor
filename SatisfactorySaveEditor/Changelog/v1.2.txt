Version 1.2

Released: 2019-06-12 18:55:08 UTC

You can now duplicate and delete entries from the file.
Be aware that it will not automatically update related/dependent entries in the file.
For example deleting a container this way will not get rid of the inventory entry of said container.

The UI should also work consistently now.
