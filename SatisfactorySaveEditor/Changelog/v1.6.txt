Version 1.6

Released: 2019-07-21 14:50:26 UTC

New Feature: Region based deleter

The region deleter allows you to remove entries based on map location.

Usage is quite simple:

Load a save file and open the region deleter (Menu: General Actions).
Repeatedly click on the map to set coordinates of a polygon.
The polygon is rendered after the 3rd click.

After you marked the region you want to clear, use the [DEL] key or the menu.
This will show a list of all objects about to be removed and those being ignored.
Using the [DEL] key you can move selected entries between the two lists.

Other changes

- Forms can now be closed using the [ESC] key
- Updater no longer fires in debug mode.
- Reorganizing "General Actions" menu to combine the two delete options.
- Added icons
