Version 1.9

Released: 2019-07-27 19:36:57 UTC

The primary function of this update is to allow the user to automatically report errors.
If the user wants to, it uploads the log,
error message and current save file to our server for later analysis.

More Features:

- Windows that pop up are now placed more predictable
- Some dialog windows were enlarged to avoid clipping of controls in Windows 8 and later.
- Object counter. Shows types and numbers of all things in your save file.
- Protect hub from being deleted by default in map area delete mode.
- "M" button in object deleter now shows the correct item (was off by one)
