Version 1.3

Released: 2019-06-30 11:55:18 UTC

UI overhaul

The UI has been changed to add new features.

Shortcuts

The File menu now has commonly accepted shortcuts.
For example CTRL+O to open or F5 to refresh the map.

Settings

A settings class has been added to remember settings.
There are no user changeable settings as of now,
but it already remembers which alert boxes it has shown to you.

Short names

Much shorter names are now displayed in drop down fields.
The ordering is still alphabetical

Map

There is now a map in the main window that renders a crude list of items on your map.
It shows nodes, natural items and player generated items as well as the player position(s).

The map is automatically exported to the save file location each time you reload it using [F5] or the menu.

Note: I don't know the actual ingame map coordinates exactly.
The map you will see is only an approximation of the real position but close enough to give you a general overview
