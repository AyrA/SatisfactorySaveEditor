Satisfactory Save Editor Main Form

This is the window where you do most of your changes.
The main area of the window is used to show a map of your save file.
An image of the map is saved in the same location your current save game is at.

Automatic Backups
=================
This editor will automatically create a single backup of any file you save,
provided that no such backup already exists.
To create multiple backups, use the Save File Manager [CTRL]+[M].

File Menu
=========

This provides basic File operations
and has the usual commands (Load, Save, Exit, ...) you find in this menu in most applications.

Quick Actions Menu
==================

This provides pre-made bulk actions for your save file.
They are mostly made of features that clean up the map and undo player made changes.

General Actions Menu
====================

This provides general editing capabilities of the save file.

More Menu
=========

This provides actions not related to save file editing.
All options in this menu are going to work without a loaded save file

Help Menu
=========

Provides help and information.
This menu also contains a manual update check option for when you disable automatic update checks.

Update Available Menu
=====================

This red menu item is only shown when an update has been downloaded sucessfully and is ready for installation.
Clicking this is optional. If you don't, the update is installed during the next launch.

Command Line
============

Basic operations are available as command line mode now.
This mode is invoked when at least one "switch" is provided.
If only a file name is provided, it will open that file in the normal user interface mode.
Be aware that this application is not a true command line application.
It will spawn its own command line window and always waits for a user key press at the end.
You can combine multiple arguments.
