Satisfactory Save Editor Object Counter

This form counts all objects in your save file.

You can select multiple entries with the mouse by holding down [SHIFT] or [CTRL].

Pressing [ENTER] renders the selected items on the main window map.
Double clicking on an entry renders that item only.

Entries with a "disabled" background color don't have coordinates, or they are unset.
The button on the bottom of the window allows you to show and hide those items.
