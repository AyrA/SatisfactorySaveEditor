Satisfactory Save Editor Object Exporter

Here you can export and import individual items or groups of them.

Data format:

The exporter uses XML as underlying data format.
If you feel confident enough, you can edit it in a text editor before importing again.

Exporting:

Select the item, offset and count you want to export, then click the "Export" button.
The exported content is placed as text in your clipboard.
Feel free to either import it into another save file (see "Import" below) or save it in a text editor of your choice.

Note: Exports ARE NOT cumulative. Exporting will erase previously exported content from the clipboard.

Import:

Click the "Import" button to import whatever entries are in your clipboard.
Optionally apply one of these options:

"Remove identical existing entries" deletes all entries of the same types you try to import.
For example when you import foundations, it will delete all foundations in the file before importing yours.
This option is most useful if you want to import entries that are not supposed to exist multiple times.

"Fix internal names" changes the 'InternalName' property of imported items when needed to avoid duplicates.
This is necessary because this name is supposed to be unique. It is therefore a good idea to leave enabled.

Note: This will not change references that no longer point to a valid name because it was changed.
In most cases, this is not a problem. It will cause some objects to not work properly,
for example storage containers.
