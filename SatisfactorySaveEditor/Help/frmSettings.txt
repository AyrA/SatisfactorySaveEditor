Satisfactory Save Editor Settings

Here you can change various settings.
They are saved immediately when you make a change.

Dialog Boxes
============

In this section you can mark all hint dialogs as read or unread.

Update Settings
===============

In this section you can change update related settings.

You can turn automatic updates on or off.
If they are on, we check for updates once at most every 24 hours.
If you turn them off, you get a manual "Check for Updates" in the "Help" main menu.

After a successful update the change log is shown to give you a quick info of the changes.
You can turn this off using the second checkbox in this section.
You can still at any time bring up the changelog window in the "Help" main menu

How Automatic Updates Work
==========================

Automatic updates are only checked for when the editor is running.
We do not install and run background applications.
This would go against the portable nature of this application.

During the update, no personal or statistical information is sent to our server.
The update checker gets a document from our server that contains the latest version and a download link.
If your version is older, the file is downloaded.
After a successful download, you get the red "Update Available" main menu item.
You can click this item to install the update immediately, or you can ignore it,
in which case the update is installed during the next start.
Installation takes about half a second as of now.
