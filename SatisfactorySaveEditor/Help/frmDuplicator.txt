Satisfactory Save Editor Item Duplicator

You can clone any kind of entry with this window,
including those you almost certainly should not.

You can optionally apply an offset to the copied item.
When cloning multiple times, the offset is calculated from the previously placed object,
essentially creating a chain of them.

Be aware that map coordinate units are approximately centimeters.
An 8x2 foundation is therefore X=800, Y=800, Z=200

The offset is pretty much mandatory when cloning an object lots of times to avoid significant lag.

The [M] button will render your selection (without potential duplicates) on the main window map.

Tip: After you are done duplicating and are back to the main window, press [F5] to refresh the map.
