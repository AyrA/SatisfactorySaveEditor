Satisfactory Save Editor Rename

Here you can rename the session name and file name of a save file.
Session name and File name must be valid file names.
This means, these characters are forbidden:

\ / " : ? * < > |

Additionally forbidden are some special unicode characters and the "NULL" character.
The "OK" button will become unavailable immediately if any invalid characters are entered or a box is empty.
