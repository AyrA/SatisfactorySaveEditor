Satisfactory Save Editor Audio Extracter

This form helps you in extracting audio files from your satisfactory game.
Files included are:
- Music
- Ambient noise
- A.D.A messages

The files have an invalid header and are fixed up properly to play in any standard player.
Most files are RIFF WAVE, A.D.A messages are OGG.

WAV Format: PCM, 16 bit, LE, 2ch(Stereo)
OGG Format: Opus, VBR, 1ch(Mono), Converter arguments: --vbr --padding 0 --bitrate 64 --comp 10 --serial 0 --framesize 20

Thanks to the uncompressed wav files you will find that the music sounds great.

Game Required
=============
You need to have the game installed.
Doesn't matters if it's the weekend demo, early access or experimental version.
The experimental version tends to give most files.

Finding the file
================
We try to find the required file for you when you open the form.

Manual file search
==================
If it's not possible to find the file automatically, you can search for it manually.
You need to specify the "FactoryGame-WindowsNoEditor.pak" file.
It's inside the "FactoryGame\Content\Paks" folder of your satisfactory installation.

WARNING! You can select files from other games.
This is likely not going to extract the files properly unless they are unencrypted.
For wav files, they will be unusable unless they are in the format specified above.

Automatic file search
=====================
As an alternative, the automatic search is offered.
This will scan all hard drives (it will not scan network drives or removable drives)

Audio extraction
================
Audio extraction is done in two steps.
First, we scan the entire game file for audio streams.
This is a time consuming process because the file is 15 GB in size.

The second step is filtering and extraction of the actual files.
We remove files that are invalid and export all others, ordered by type, then size descending.
This means you end up with the background music first and the A.D.A. messages last.

Player
======
This application features a very crude audio player that's displayed when at least one file has been found.
It's meant to preview the files. For proper playback, add the files in the "Audio" directory to your audio player.

Note: This application uses QuickPlay.exe to play the audio files.
It will automatically be downloaded if it doesn't exists.
If the player controls are disabled, but you have audio files present, make sure QuickPlay exists.
If not, you can either relaunch the save editor to start the download again,
or you can download it manually at https://gitload.net/AyrA/QuickPlay
and place it into the directory that contains the save editor.

File protection
===============
Files will not be overwritten.
If you want to search for audio files again (for example after an update),
you have to delete the contents of the "Audio" folder.
