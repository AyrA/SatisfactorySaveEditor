Satisfactory Save Editor Cloud File Editor

This window allows you to edit the properties of maps in your cloud account.

Conflicting categories are automatically disabled.
If you can't select a checkbox, it's because another category is mutually exclusive to the disabled one.

Enabled category checkboxes have a tooltip on mouse hover that describes the category.

You can also change the hidden id.
Note that this change is in effect immediately, you don't need to save other changes.
